*maelstrom* is a collection of custom PyMC3 Models built on top of the excellent *exoplanet* package for
modelling binary orbits through the phase modulation technique.
This approach fully captures variations in a light curve caused by 
an orbital companion.

To install the current developer version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielhey/maelstrom.git
cd maelstrom
pip install -e .
```
